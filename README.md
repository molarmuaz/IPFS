Inter-Planetary File System

Project for the Data Structures Course. A filing system that implements distributed hash tables to store files in a network of computers where each file has a unique hash value. This makes searching for these files easier and faster, especially in a large set of files; furthermore, the files with the same name can also be distinguished using these hash addresses.
